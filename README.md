# 📁 **Projects**

### [Evaluating and Optimizing Online Speaker Diarization in Dynamic Conversational Environments](https://github.com/priyankaroy27/MMDS_MasterThesis)
- Designed real-time pipelines for dynamic, multi-speaker conversations
- Integrated and benchmarked state-of-the-art models to balance latency and accuracy
- Reduced Diarization Error Rate (DER) to 23%, representing a 4% absolute improvement over comparable ongoing research using the pyannote framework
- Fine-tuned segmentation and clustering thresholds to reduce error rate while maintaining low-latency inference

### [Foodle - Real Time Cooking Assistant](https://github.com/priyankaroy27/Foodle)
- Developed an interactive voice based assistant for amateur chefs using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Converted spoken instructions into structured recipes
- Making interaction barrier-free with speech-based navigation and language inclusivity 

### [Speaker-Aware Voice Assistant](https://github.com/priyankaroy27/STARTHACK25_Helbling)
- Developed a voice-based assistant that identifies speakers, transcribes conversations and personalizes interactions by remembering user preferences
- Enhanced user experience by enabling seamless, memory-driven conversations for both new and returning customers

### [MapX - Automated Schema Mapping](https://github.com/priyankaroy27/MapX-Automated_Schema_Mapping)
- Developed a tool for schema mapping across databases using sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### [SBA Loan Approval - Risk Classification using ML][https://github.com/priyankaroy27/SBA-Loan-Approval)
- Built a binary classification model to predict loan repayment outcomes. Designed to support banks in optimizing risk-aware loan decisions for SMEs
- Conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand class imbalance, outliers, key risk indicators and correlations with default rates
- Engineered meaningful features and cleaned inconsistent data entries for modeling readiness
- Trained and optimized classification models including XGBoost and Random Forest, achieving a macro F1-score of 0.99 on test data
